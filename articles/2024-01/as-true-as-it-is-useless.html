    <h1>“As True as It Is Useless”. Tales from Misunderstood Models of Understanding</h1>
    
    <p>
        A few months ago I was discussing the then recent game release 
        <i>Starfield</i> on an online forum. I had openly questioned why 
        the faces of the in-game characters looked so much more disturbing
        than those in previous Bethesda Game Studios release when another 
        commenter excitedly informed me that it was <i>just</i> the result of 
        the uncanny valley effect. And I told them that this answer was
        as true as it is useless.
    </p>

    <p>
        Truth be told this was not the first time I’ve come to use this
        rhetorical epithet. In studying the social sciences the ability to
        point out when an interlocutor has responded to your question with a
        mere statement of a related fact masquerading as an answer proves to be
        remarkably valuable. And so I would like to take my—admittedly 
        pithy—rhetoric and expound upon why I find these responses to be
        insufficient responses to such lines of inquiry.
    </p>

    <p>
        And so, why does a reference to the uncanny valley not answer my 
        question about <i>Starfield’s</i> disturbing faces? We know that as a
        non-human object such as an robot or a character model approaches a
        realistic human likeness there is a range of realism, referred to as 
        the uncanny valley at which positive and empathetic sentiments turn to
        feelings of revulsion. And so the implication of my online 
        correspondent is very clear in that the in-game character models fall
        within this range, and therefore induce this response. But the issue
        with this reasoning, in my view, is that it is only sufficient in so
        far as it characterises the category of phenomena which this example
        falls into, and doesn’t investigate the specific example itself. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I feel it is therefore worthwhile to to analyse more closely the
        constituents components of the <i>Starfield</i> models in order to
        consider <i>why</i> they might fall into this range of realism.
    </p>

    <p>
        And one factor which I feel heavily contributes to the disturbing
        nature of these facial models is the manner in which they are presented
        to the player. Quite notably during the in-game dialogue scenes the
        camera shot is framed as in extreme close-up right on the characters
        face. In doing so the designers have physically placed the player much
        more intimately close with the characters. And in doing so they hold the
        player hostage beneath the character’s dead-eyed stare; forced to gaze
        upon the emotionless abyss of their too-smooth skin and unyielding hair.
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to the concept’s emergence from the study of robotics discussions
        that centre around the uncanny valley tend to sideline presentational
        aspects such as this. It predisposes us to thinking about the objects
        we’re discussing as innately disturbing and not necessarily as being
        framed to us in a discomforting way. And this is the fundamental error
        my correspondent made by trying to dismissively label away the problem.
        It’s not so much that their reasoning was unsound or based on false
        premises, but that it was incompletely correct, and therefore limiting
        as to the scope of our inquiry.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is particularly disappointing when discussing a developing 
        discipline such as game design. From a practical perspective these
        incomplete discussions hinder our ability as analysts to give actually
        insightful feedback about how to improve upon these issues in future
        releases. One can easily imagine a character designer reeling at the
        non-specific feedback to make the characters “less uncanny valley-ey”.
        But at a far more conceptual level I worry that blind appeals to these
        neatly constructed categorical labels prevent us from achieving true
        understanding of the issues we’re discussing.

    <p id="fnref:2">
        Above sits the Waterman map projection; a world map which its marketing
        copy boldly states “will one day be in every classroom” 
        <a class="button" href="#fn:2">2</a> as a replacement for
        the much more widely used mercator and robinson map projections.
    </p>

    <p>
        The reasoning given for this statement is that the waterman butterfly
        is derived from a process which least distorts aspects such as
        continent’s sizes, shapes and relative positions during the conversion
        from globe to map. This is in reference to a mathematical problem that
        there is no known way to perfectly maintain the characteristics of a
        sphere’s surface during it’s transformation into a flat plane.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Like many people I was first made aware of the debate around map
        projections by an episode of <i>The West Wing</i> in which the
        White House Press Secretary, C.J. Cregg, attends a meeting with members 
        from the fictional Organisation of Cartographers for Social Equality
        (OCSE). During this meeting the cartographers she speaks with clearly
        outline the issues with continuing to use the mercator projection as the
        basis for map designs. Namely, the ways in which it distorts the
        relative sizes of landmasses by enlarging areas near the poles and thus
        presents Greenland for example as the same size as Africa despite only
        being 1/14th its size. For these reasons they recommend switching out
        the outdated mercator maps in favour of the Gall–Peters projection.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the OCSE’s main speaker, Dr. John Fallow, concludes:
    </p>

    <blockquote id="fnref:3">
        “When third world countries are misrepresented, they’re likely to be
        valued less. When mercator maps exaggerate the importance of western
        civilisation; when the top of the map is given to the northern 
        hemisphere, and the bottom is given to the southern then people will tend
        to adopt top and bottom attitudes.”
        <a class="button" href="#fn:3">3</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        It’s a fantastically effective piece of rhetoric from script writers
        Paul Redford and Aaron Sorkin which, unfortunately, is in service of an
        outcome that runs counter to the very issues it’s trying to resolve.
    </p>

    <p>
        What the OCSE, and the marketers of the Waterman Projection fail to
        answer is why geography students should be taught using a singular map
        projection in the first place. If the intent of these proposed
        educational changes are to circumvent these political and social biases
        then would it not be far more effective to instead use Geography to
        teach students <i>about</i> map projections and the ways in which they
        distort the world?
    </p>

    <p>
        The truth is that even distorted models have some value in their ability
        to demonstrate not the world as it actually is but our relationship with
        that world. Despite its topological beauty it is none the less difficult
        to conceptualise how, exactly, one travels from Africa to Australia
        across the Waterman Butterfly’s fragmented surface. And the Gall–Peters
        projection, despite impressive claims about its correct relative sizes
        of landmasses, achieves this ideal at the cost of grossly distorting
        their shapes.
    </p>

    <p id="fnref:4">
        Maps have a fantastic ability to sum up the world into a single clear
        image; placing it on a single simultaneously observable plane. This is a
        feature that not even the most accurate model (a globe) can lay claim to.
        But any model—no matter how precise—will have its own set of reductions, 
        exaggerations, and omissions. It is only by placing these disparate
        models in dialogue with one another, with clear attention to each's
        individual quirks that we are truly able to deepen our understanding of 
        the world and our place in it. To do otherwise is to simply trade one
        set of flawed biases for another.
        <a class="button" href="#fn:4">4</a>
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        This issue of not properly recognising either the value and/or problems
        associated with our models of understanding rears itself quite
        frequently in the manner in which music theory is taught, presented, and
        discussed. Consider the following theoretic description of Mozart's 19th
        String Quartet:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        The first movement’s andante introduction begins with an ostinato 8th
        note pulse played by the cello beginning on C. This is joined
        successively by an Ab from the viola, followed by an Eb from the second
        violin and a high A from the first as the viola descends to a G. This is
        done to avoid the semitone clash between the first violin and viola in
        favour of a lesser harmonic dissonance; best interpreted as a Cmin6 
        chord. The upper three voices continue in counterpoint for the following
        two measures as the bass descends chromatically before the sequence
        repeats a tone lower.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The above is certainly a detailed, technical, and accurate description.
        And yet—quite notably—not a single reader of this article, presently
        knows what this introduction sounds like. And this problem runs deeper
        than the audience simply not having the requisite knowledge to
        understand what is being said. Even the most ardent music theory
        scholars will only be able to transmute an analysis like the one above
        into at best a way in which to assign the introduction into some sort of
        categorical reduction; thinking of it as perhaps “one of those weird
        dissonant openings” or some other category.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hold this to be a fundamental restriction of musico-theoretic 
        analysis. Put simply, that it can tell you absolutely everything about a
        piece of music except how it sounds; what the experience of listening to
        it is like.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet, this limitation of the discipline is so rarely acknowledged in
        the way that it’s taught and discussed. A brief perusal of forums such
        as the music theory subreddit provides ample examples of people treating
        these theoretical tenets as absolute rules about the nature of music,
        how it functions, and the way that it sounds. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, in most circumstances this is most likely just the result of
        implied assumptions which arise from our casual uses of language. A
        commentator might ask “what’s this song’s scale?” rather than the more
        formal “what scales can we interpret this song as using?” more out of
        convenience than a desire to make a statement about some <i>true</i>
        verifiable nature of the piece discussed.
    </p>

    <p>
        But in some circumstances the assumptions made by music theory about the
        important and valuable aspects of music are weaponised; often for the
        intent of disparaging a piece or style which doesn’t meet the author’s
        personal standards and opinions. This practice is at least as old as
        institutional academic music research and has historically been used by
        academics as a cultural tool for classist assaults on ther lower-class,
        and their purportedly ‘lesser’ musical sensibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take the following indictment of popular music from Theodore Adorno:
    </p>

    <blockquote id="fnref:5">
        “The whole structure of popular music is standardized, even where the
        attempt is made to circumvent standardization. Standardization extends
        from the most general features to the most specific ones. Best known is
        the rule that the chorus consists of thirty two bars and that the range
        is limited to one octave and one note.”
        <a class="button" href="#fn:5">5</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        This ‘standardised’ conception of popular music is positioned in
        contrast to the supposedly ‘serious’ classical music arising from the
        European Common Practice tradition. But—in service of his 
        rhetoric—places extremely strict boundaries on what elements of music
        can possibly be standardized.
    </p>

    <p>
        Adorno’s argument is centered on a conceptualisation of music in which
        melody, harmony, rhythm, and form are the only elements of music through
        which one piece differentiates itself from another. And it falls apart
        as soon as any other musical elements are taken into consideration.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What are we to make of popular music’s vast array of experiments
        with regard to the timbre of sound? Even at the time Adorno was
        writing popular music singers—as one example—displayed a far greater
        variety of vocal styles than those present amongst singers from the
        standardised operatic tradition. And what of the varied performance
        practices present in popular music communities, with their thriving
        audiences and overflowing mosh pits? Surely these present a greater
        variety of musical experiences than the strict rules familiar to those
        confined in the concert hall, scared to cough and not clapping
        between movements.
    </p>

    <p>
        But these vast and highly affective differences between the experiences
        of popular music pieces are ignored by Adorno and his proponents. At
        best best they may be regarded as mere ornaments atop what they consider
        the actually important structural components of a musical work.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is, in my view, the true danger of how these types of theory laden
        conceptualisations are so often treated as objective observations. They
        become so entirely entwined with a single way through which the world
        can be labelled, categorized and understood that they become
        incompatible with any other interpretation.
        They become as true within their model as they are useless outside of it.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        It should be made clear that all of this is not to say that we should
        erase these problematic models entirely. The uncanny valley is a
        fascinating framework for ongoing research, map projections are
        excellent representations of the Earth as it appears to be, and music
        analysis can be an incredibly useful diagnostic tool for composers. Even
        jargon, when used within the confines of a particular community assists
        greatly in its ability to concisely refer to complex ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
        But there is a fundamental problem with how easily the existence of a
        model becomes a convenient excuse to avoid actually investigating the
        object which it models. The path toward true understanding of a concept
        requires much more rigour and thorough investigation than merely
        enough to label it and we do ourselves a disservice by so often
        pretending otherwise. Because you don’t gain control over something by
        merely giving it a name.
