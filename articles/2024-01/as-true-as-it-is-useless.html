    <h1>“As True as It Is Useless”. Tales from Misunderstood Models of Understanding</h1>
    
    <p>
        A few months ago I was discussing the then recent game release 
        <i>Starfield</i> on a game analysis forum. My colleagues and I had been
        questioning for some time why we felt the faces of the game's characters
        felt so much more disturbing than those in previous Bethesda Game
        Studios releases. At this point a new commentator joined the discussion 
        to excitedly inform us that it was <i>just</i> the result of the uncanny
        valley effect. And I told them that this answer was as true as it is
        useless.
    </p>

    <p>
        Truth be told this was not the first time I’ve come to use this
        rhetorical epithet. It proves to be a remarkably valuable way to point
        out when an interlocutor has responded to your question with a mere
        statement of a related fact masquerading as an answer. And so I would
        like to take my—admittedly pithy—rhetoric and expound upon why I find
        such responses to be insufficient answers to lines of inquiry.
    </p>

    <p>
        And so, why does a reference to the uncanny valley not answer my 
        question about <i>Starfield’s</i> disturbing faces? We know that as a
        non-human object such as an robot or a character model approaches a
        realistic human likeness there is a range of realism, referred to as 
        the uncanny valley, at which positive and empathetic sentiments turn to
        feelings of revulsion. And so the implication of my online 
        correspondent is very clear in that the in-game character models fall
        within this range, and therefore induce this response. But the issue
        with this reasoning, in my view, is that it is only sufficient in so
        far as it characterises the category of phenomena which this example
        falls into, and doesn’t investigate the specific example itself. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I feel it is therefore worthwhile to to analyse more closely the
        constituent components of the <i>Starfield</i> models in order to
        consider <i>why</i> they might induce this response.
    </p>

    <img class="figure" src="./images/starfield-character.png" alt="A game screenshot of a character from Starfield">

    <p>
        In our forum discussion we noted a number of possible features which
        most likely contribute to this emotional disposition. For example,
        the incongruity between the material design of the game characters'
        clothing and that of their skin. The former appears to be somewhat
        cartoonishly stylised; overly smooth and plasticky in comparison to the
        faux-realistic pores and wrinkles of their body. Or the fact that in
        movement these characters seem rigid. Their eyes lock onto the virtual
        camera in a manner that feels disassociated from their head movements,
        and their hair is fixed to their scalp without any movement or flow.
        It feels at times like the player is speaking to an overly gelled-up
        real estate agent who's read one too many articles about the importance of
        maintaining eye contact while closing the deal.
    </p>
    <p>
        But one factor which I feel heavily contributes to the disturbing
        affect of these facial models is the manner in which they are presented
        to the player. Quite notably during the in-game dialogue scenes the
        camera shot is framed as in extreme close-up right on the character’s
        face with a bokeh blur applied to the background ensuring the players
        attention is laid exclusively on them alone. In doing this the designers
        place the player much too intimately close with the characters.
        And this makes them feel as if they are held hostage in the
        conversation; forced to gaze upon the emotionless abyss of their
        locked-on eyes and unyielding hair.
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to the concept’s emergence from the study of robotics discussions
        that centre around the uncanny valley tend to sideline presentational
        aspects such as this. The conceptual framework predisposes us to
        thinking about the objects we’re discussing as innately disturbing and
        not necessarily as being framed to us in a discomforting way. And we can
        see in this the fundamental error which my correspondent made by trying
        to dismissively label away the problem. It’s not so much that their
        reasoning was unsound or based on false premises, but that it was
        <i>incompletely</i> correct, and therefore overly limiting on the scope of inquiry.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is particularly disappointing when discussing a developing 
        discipline such as game design. From a practical perspective such blind
        appeals to these incomplete frameworks hinder our ability as analysts to
        give insightful feedback about how to improve upon these issues in
        future works. One can easily imagine a character designer reeling at the
        non-specific feedback to make the characters “less uncanny valley-ey”.
        But at a far more conceptual level I worry that blind appeals to these
        neatly constructed categorical labels prevent us from achieving true
        understanding of the issues we’re discussing.
    </p>

    <p id="fnref:1">
        These argumentative fallacies are frustratingly common in fields such as
        philosophy and the social sciences. I have sat through many a tutorial
        where my fellow students’ arguments take the form that such-and-such
        example is best outlined by, say, Gadamer’s fusion of horizons or some
        other appeal to the authority of an existing conceptual framework. Such
        arguments are certainly effective in showing that a student has done the
        reading for the week but demonstrating actual engagement with an example
        requires far more than merely applying the correct sequence of terms and
        labels in a discussion of it. <a class="button" href="#fn:1">1</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        However, I don’t wish to delimit this discussion to merely linguistic
        constraints. The issues in how models effect our thinking and
        understanding of the world run far deeper than some quirk of language
        and in fact, pervade any model with which we choose to represent the
        world around us.
    </p>

    <img class="figure" src="./images/waterman-projection.jpg" alt="Map of the World Based on the Waterman Butterfly Map Projection">

    <p id="fnref:2">
        Above sits the Waterman map projection; a world map which its marketing
        copy boldly states “will one day be in every classroom” 
        <a class="button" href="#fn:2">2</a> as a replacement for
        the much more widely used mercator and robinson map projections.
    </p>

    <p>
        The reasoning given for this statement is that the waterman butterfly
        is derived from a process which least distorts aspects such as
        continent’s sizes, shapes and relative positions during the conversion
        from globe to map. This is in reference to a mathematical problem that
        there is no known way to perfectly maintain the characteristics of a
        sphere’s surface during its transformation into a flat plane.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Like many people I was first made aware of the debate around map
        projections by an episode of <i>The West Wing</i> in which the
        White House Press Secretary, C.J. Cregg, attends a meeting with members 
        from the fictional Organisation of Cartographers for Social Equality
        (OCSE). During this meeting the cartographers she speaks with clearly
        outline the issues with continuing to use the mercator projection as the
        basis for map designs. Namely, the ways in which it distorts the
        relative sizes of landmasses by enlarging areas near the poles and thus
        presents, for example, Greenland at the same size as Africa despite the
        former being only 1/14th the size in reality. For these reasons they
        recommend switching out the outdated mercator maps used in schools in
        favour of the Gall–Peters projection, which greatly reduces these
        distortions.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the OCSE’s main speaker, Dr. John Fallow, concludes:
    </p>

    <blockquote id="fnref:3">
        “When third world countries are misrepresented, they’re likely to be
        valued less. When mercator maps exaggerate the importance of western
        civilisation; when the top of the map is given to the northern 
        hemisphere, and the bottom is given to the southern then people will
        tend to adopt top and bottom attitudes.”
        <a class="button" href="#fn:3">3</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        It’s a fantastically effective piece of rhetoric from script writers
        Paul Redford and Aaron Sorkin which, unfortunately, is in service of an
        outcome that runs counter to the very issues it’s trying to resolve.
    </p>

    <p>
        The question the OCSE, and the marketers of the Waterman Projection
        neglect to answer is why geography students should still be taught using
        a singular map projection in the first place. If the intent of these
        proposed educational changes is to circumvent these political and social
        biases then would it not be far more effective to instead use Geography
        to teach students <i>about</i> map projections and the ways in which
        they distort the world?
    </p>

    <p>
        The truth is that even distorted models have some value in their ability
        to demonstrate not the world as it actually is but our relationship with
        that world. Despite its topological beauty it is none the less difficult
        to conceptualise how, exactly, one travels from Africa to Australia
        across the Waterman Butterfly’s fragmented surface. And the Gall–Peters
        projection, despite impressive claims about its correct relative sizes
        of landmasses, achieves this ideal at the cost of grossly distorting
        their shapes.
    </p>

    <p id="fnref:4">
        Maps have a fantastic ability to sum up the world into a single clear
        image; placing it on a single simultaneously observable plane. This is a
        feature that not even the most accurate model (a globe) can lay claim to.
        But any model—no matter how precise—will have its own set of reductions, 
        exaggerations, and omissions. It is only by placing these disparate
        models in dialogue with one another, with clear attention paid to each 
        one’s individual quirks that we are truly able to deepen our
        understanding of the world and our place in it. To do otherwise is to
        simply trade one set of flawed biases for another.
        <a class="button" href="#fn:4">4</a>
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        This issue of not properly recognising either the value and/or problems
        associated with our models of understanding rears itself quite
        frequently in the manner in which music theory is taught, presented, and
        discussed. Consider the following theoretic description of Mozart's 19th
        String Quartet:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        The first movement’s andante introduction begins with an ostinato 8th
        note pulse played by the cello beginning on C. This is joined
        successively by an Ab from the viola, followed by an Eb from the second
        violin and a high A from the first as the viola descends to a G. This is
        done to avoid the semitone clash between the first violin and viola in
        favour of a lesser harmonic dissonance; best interpreted as a Cmin6 
        chord. The upper three voices continue in counterpoint for the following
        two measures as the bass descends chromatically before the sequence
        repeats a tone lower.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The above is certainly a detailed, technical, and accurate description.
        And yet—quite notably—not a single reader of this article presently
        knows what the introduction to this piece sounds like. And this problem
        runs deeper than the audience simply not having the requisite knowledge
        to understand what is being said. Even the most ardent music theory
        scholars will only be able to transmute an analysis like the one above
        into at best a way in which to assign the introduction into some sort of
        categorical reduction; thinking of it as perhaps “one of those weird
        dissonant openings” or some other category.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hold this to be a fundamental restriction of musico-theoretic 
        analysis. Put simply, that it can tell you absolutely everything about a
        piece of music except how it sounds; what the actual experience of
        listening to it is like.
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet, this limitation of the discipline is so rarely acknowledged.
        A brief perusal of forums such as the music theory subreddit provides
        ample examples of people stating these theoretical tenets as absolute
        rules about the nature of music, how it functions, and the way that it
        sounds. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Admittedly, in most circumstances this is most likely just the result of
        implied assumptions which arise from our casual uses of language. A
        commentator might ask “what’s this song’s scale?” rather than the more
        formal “what scales can we interpret this song as using?” more out of
        convenience than a desire to make a statement about some <i>true</i>
        verifiable nature of the piece discussed.
    </p>

    <p>
        But in some circumstances the assumptions made by music theory about the
        important and valuable aspects of music are weaponised; often for the
        intent of disparaging a piece or style which doesn’t meet the author’s
        personal standards and opinions. This practice is at least as old as
        institutional academic music research and has historically been used by
        academics as a tool for classist assaults on ther lower-class, and their
        purportedly ‘lesser’ aesthetic sensibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take the following indictment of popular music from Theodore Adorno:
    </p>

    <blockquote id="fnref:5">
        “The whole structure of popular music is standardized, even where the
        attempt is made to circumvent standardization. Standardization extends
        from the most general features to the most specific ones. Best known is
        the rule that the chorus consists of thirty two bars and that the range
        is limited to one octave and one note.”
        <a class="button" href="#fn:5">5</a>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        This ‘standardised’ conception of popular music is positioned in
        contrast to the supposedly ‘serious’ classical music arising from the
        European Common Practice tradition. And Adorno—in service of his 
        rhetoric—places extremely strict boundaries on what elements of music
        can possibly be standardized.
    </p>

    <p>
        His argument is centered on a conceptualisation of music in which
        melody, harmony, rhythm, and form are the only elements of through which
        one piece meaningfully differentiates itself from another. And it falls
        apart as soon as any other musical elements are taken into
        consideration.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        What are we to make of popular music’s vast array of experiments
        with regard to the timbre of sound? Even at the time Adorno was
        writing popular music singers—as merely one example—displayed a far
        greater variety of vocal styles than those present amongst singers from
        the standardised operatic tradition. And what of the varied performance
        practices present in popular music communities, with their thriving
        audiences and overflowing mosh pits? Surely these present a greater
        variety of musical experiences than the strict rules familiar to those
        confined in the concert hall; scared to cough, and not clapping
        between movements.
    </p>

    <p>
        But these vast and highly affective differences between the experiences
        of popular music pieces are ignored by Adorno and his proponents. At
        best best they may be regarded as mere ornaments atop what they consider
        the actually meaningful structural components of a musical work.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is, in my view, the true danger in how these types of theory laden
        conceptualisations are so often treated as objective observations. They
        become so entirely entwined with a single way through which the world
        can be labelled, categorised, and understood that they become
        incompatible with any other interpretation. They become as true within
        their model as they are useless outside of it.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        It should be made clear that all of this is not in service of saying
        that we should erase these problematic models entirely. The uncanny
        valley is a fascinating framework for ongoing research, map projections
        are excellent representations of the Earth as it appears to be, and
        music analysis can be an incredibly useful diagnostic tool for
        composers.
    </p>

    <p>
        But there is a fundamental problem with how easily the existence of a
        model becomes a convenient excuse to avoid actually investigating the
        object which it models. The path toward true understanding of a concept
        requires much more rigour and thorough investigation than that required
        to initially label it, and we do ourselves a disservice by so often
        pretending otherwise. Because you don’t gain control over something by
        merely giving it a name.
