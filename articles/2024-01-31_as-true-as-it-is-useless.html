        <h1>“As True as It Is Useless”. Tales from Misunderstood 
            Models of Understanding</h1>
        <p>
            A few months ago I was discussing the then recent game release 
            <i>Starfield</i> on an online forum. I had openly questioned why 
            the faces of the in-game characters looked so much more disturbing
            than those in previous Bethesda Game Studios release when another 
            commenter excitedly informed me that it was <i>just</i> the result of 
            the uncanny valley effect. And I told them that this answer was
            as true as it is useless.
        </p>

        <p>
            Truth be told this was not the first time I've come to use this 
            rhetorical epithet. In studying the social sciences the ability to
            point out when an interlocutor has responded to your question with
            a mere statement of a related fact masquerading as an answer proves
            to be remarkably valuable. And so I would like to take my—
            admittedly pithy—rhetoric and expound upon why I find such 
            responses to be distasteful.
