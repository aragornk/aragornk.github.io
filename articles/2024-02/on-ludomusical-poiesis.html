    <h1>On Ludomusical Poiesis. <br/> Or, “So What Does a Ludomusicologist <i>Do</i> Anyway?”</h1>
    <p>
        “But nothing you've said so far reconciles the fact that ‘performance’
        indicates a level of intentionality that ‘poiesis’ simply doesn’t.”
    </p>

    <p>
        My colleague and I have been arguing for 6 straight hours right into the
        deep hours of the night. Our discussion has spanned millenia of thought
        from Plato’s metaphysics to Peirce and Nattiez’s semiotic theories, and
        even Butler’s concepts of gender performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        We’ve spent the evening keeping alight a crucible; one in which
        irrelevancies are burned away until we are left with a pure product: the
        truth. And—as per the traditional meaning of symposium—we’re moderately
        drunk at this point.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s perhaps no wonder that we have yet to decide whether the third word
        in this article’s title should be ‘performance’ or ‘poiesis’.

        <a href="../2024-01/as-true-as-it-is-useless.html">Last month</a> I
        spoke in some detail about those oft-misuderstood models of
        understanding. I outlined there why I believe it is important to
        acknowledge the nature of these products of the social sciences; the way
        in which they represent the observations of the natural sciences not in
        the most strictly true manner, but the manner which makes those
        observations more easily intelligible to their audience.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It seems pertinent, therefore, to outline the model I am personally
        responsible for constructing. And in doing so formally coin the term
        “ludomusical poiesis”, which has been one of the core pieces of my
        research in the field of video game music analysis for the past four
        years.

    <h2 id="introduction">Introdution</h2>

    <p>
        One of the key issues game music researchers face is the loose
        association betweent the musical material of a game and the
        visual/narrative components it accompanies. As a result of the medium’s
        inherent interactivity game music’s meaning can often not be understood
        merely through its direct connection to the information conveyed on the
        screen when it plays. Instead the musical material must be interpreted
        by both the player and analyst in relation to the game world and game
        states it arises from.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        One framework through which this distinction
        between the interpretive meanings of linearly sequenced audio-visual
        media and non-linear, interactive media is that provided by the field
        of semiotics. In this proposal I briefly outline the relevant
        key-concepts of semiotics and summarise how they have been historically
        applied to musical material. Then, through a case study of <i>Super
        Mario Bros.</i> for the Nintendo Entertainment System, I draw upon the
        limited field of ludomusicology to interpret the initial game state
        meanings of musical signs in the game before dicussing the player’s
        role as a musical performer who creates and configures those signs to
        the same extent as the composer and sound designer. This introduces the
        action of ludomusical poiesis which is the core concept of my research.
    </p>

    <p>
        The field of ludomusicology is still relatively new, with academic
        discussions in the discipline only beginning in earnest in the
        mid-2000s. <a class="button" id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1">1</a> And
        due to the medium’s interent interactivity one of the key concepts
        being investigated in the discipline is the participation of the player
        as a musical performer. This difference between the active musical
        involvement of the audience in interactive media as opposed to their
        passive spectatorship in linearly sequenced media requires researchers
        to adopt a fundamentally different analytical approach when
        interpreting this new compositional format.
        <a class="button" id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2">2</a>
        
    </p>
        
    <p>
        So far this has
        been approached through several different pre-existing analytical
        methods. One approach has been to study how game music composers
        approach non-linear harmonic structures. This is seen through the
        procedural generation of consonant pitches in accordance with Johann
        Fux’s counterpoint treatise as heard in <i>Spore.</i>
        <a class="button" id="fnref:3" href="#fn:3">3</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Psychological
        studies have also been referred to in order to investigate how music
        impacts upon the player’s gameplay performance to either enhance or
        impede their progression through a game. For reference, see Warren
        Brodsky’s analysis of faster-tempo music in driving games to reinforce
        the player’s impulses for faster, less accurate driving.
        <a class="button" id="fnref:4" href="#fn:4">4</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Elizabeth 
        Medina-Gray has employed form analysis by comparing modular musical
        systems to the aleatoric compositional approaches of mid-twentieth
        century composers.
        <a class="button" id="fnref:5" href="#fn:5">5</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>The field of
        hermeneutics has also been referred to by Miciel Kamp to investigate
        how players “interpret video game music for a number of practical or
        functional purposes” which are informed by their phenomenological
        experience with the game.
        <a class="button" id="fnref:6" href="#fn:6">6</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Each of
        these approaches provide interesting insight into the interactions
        between the player and the musical material of the game. However, they
        are all lacking in an ability to demonstrate what specifically that music
        is conveying to the player. I believe therefore, that the area of
        research which is best equipped to construct an analytical method into
        the creation and interpretation of game music’s extra-musical meaning
        is semiotics.
    </p>

    <hr/>

    <h2 id="peircean-semiotics">Peircean Semiotics</h2>
    <p>
        Semiotics is a discipline in which the uses and meanings of signs that
        are shared back and forth in communication are analysed. The most common
        branch of this field is primarily concerned with linguistics, and was
        developed by Ferdinand de Saussure. However, the branch of semiotics
        which is more relevant to my research is the universal approach
        developed by Charles Sanders Peirce.
    </p>
    <p> 
        Peirce summarises this universal approach as the analysis of signs as
        “anything, of whatsoever mode of
        being, which mediates between an object and an interpretant.”
        <a class="button" id="fnref:7" href="#fn:7">7</a> The three constituent
        parts of this analysis are the object, the sign, and the interpretant.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We can understand objects as anything which exists, to the extent of even
        abstract concepts such as emotions and laws. These objects are
        communicated via the means of a sign, which as outlined above can take
        any communicative form and are fed through to the interpretant. We
        understand the interpretant in this model as the impact of the sign upon
        whatever observes it. It will be important to my analysis later that
        interpretants are understood to comprise not only sentient minds but
        also any system (most relevantly computer systems) which can observe and
        be impacted by a sign.
    </p>

    <h2 id="nattiez-musical-semiotics">Nattiez’s Musical Semiotics</h2>
    <p>
        The most well cited application of Peirce’s universal semiotics to music
        studies is presented by Jean-Jacques Natties, who outlines a tripartite
        method of musical semiotics comprising three categories which “define a
        total musical fact.” <a class="button" id="fnref:8" href="#fn:8">8</a>
        This musical fact can be seen as the entire process of expressing an
        object to an interpretant through a specifically musical sign. Nattiez
        expresses these categories as the poietic level, the immanent level, and
        the esthesic level.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        These levels can be approached in terms of their
        relationship to Peirce’s conceptions of the object, sign, and
        interpretant. The poietic level is concerned with the construction of
        musical material which represents an object. This process of poiesis is
        undertaken by the musical composer in conjunction with the performer,
        often through an intermediate medium such as a musical score. This
        poietic process results in the construction of the surface musical
        details as it sounds, and these details comprise the immanent level of
        Nattiez’s tripartite method. The third level concerns the interpretation
        of that musical result by the listener or audience through the sensory
        process of esthesis.
    </p>

    <p>
        One notable difference between Nattiez’s method and
        the Peircean construct outlined above is it this final stage between the
        sign and the interpretant. Whereas Peirce defines the final stage of the
        semiotic process in terms of how the sign acts upon the interpretant,
        Nattiez takes the opposite approach; instead focusing on the manner in
        which the interpretant chooses to apply meaning to their experience of
        the sign. 
    </p>

    <img class="figure" src="./images/figure-2.png" alt="A diagram outlining Nattiez's tripartite method of musical semiosis. Objects and the poiesis process are in a box labelled Poietic, pointing to the box labelled Immanent containing signs/musical results. Another box labelled Esthesis contains the Esthesis process and Interpretants, which also point towards the Immanent box.">
    <p class="figure">
        <b>Fig. 2:</b> Nattiez’s Tripartite model of musical semiosis.
        <a class="button" id="fnref:9" href="#fn:9">9</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the most common applications of these semiotic concepts in the
        analysis of musical meaning is the use of leitmotif in opera and film
        score. In a semiotic analysis a leitmotif can be considered as a musical
        sign which communicates a narrative object to the audience of
        interpretants. An analysis of the immanent level of Wagner’s opening to
        <i>Tristan Und Isolde</i> may interpret the eponymous Tristan Chord as
        merely a modified minor seventh chord, a French sixth chord, or a
        secondary dominant. <a class="button" id="fnref:10" href="#fn:10">10</a>
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Nattiez clarifies such vertical critiques as functional functional
        analyses which should be distinguished from non-functional analyses that
        focus mode on the horizontal, linear progressions of the music by
        dealing with “the chord with respect to the melodic continuity that
        forms its context.” <a class="button" id="fnref:11" href="#fn:11">11</a>
        These non-functional analyses provide a model with which to understand
        the full esthesic context within which the audience hears the sonority
        and thus clarify the object wich the Tristan Chord as a musical sign
        communicates.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        When the narrative contexts in which the chord is heard
        are considered this object becomes crystal-clear, and the musical sign
        can—in this full, linear, and non-functional context—be understood to
        communicate the narrative object of the obstacles in the way of 
        Tristan and Isolde’s desire for one another.
        <a class="button" id="fnref:12" href="#fn:12">12</a> In Nattiez’s view
        of this analysis the defining features which inform this ethesic
        interpretation are not the immanent elements of the musical material but
        instead the linear narrative contexts in which the audience hears it.

    <h2 id="ludomusical-semiotics">Outlining Ludomusical Semiotics</h2>

    <p>
        The fundamental problem of trying to directly apply Nattiez’s Tripartite
        method of musical semiosis to video games is the non-linearity of the
        medium. As Karen Collins discusses, music in games is often even more
        malleable than narrative and visual components as it is required to
        “respond to the player’s or nonplaying character’s actions, and/or to
        in-game parameters (health timings, and so on), as well as location
        based parameters. <a class="button" id="fnref:13" href="#fn:13">13</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        In the broader field of game studies, the specific set of stories which
        arises from the player’s actions and interpretations of events within a
        game has been referred to as an ‘alterbiography’.
        <a class="button" id="fnref:14" href="#fn:14">14</a> In understanding
        how music interacts with, and narrativizes this alterbiography it is
        therefore important to formally state the different manners through
        which the player’s actions can create and configure musical signs within
        the sound system of a game.
    </p>

    <h4 id="interactive-and-adaptive">Interactive and Adaptive Musical Signs</h4>

    <p>
        The musical material offered in <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> offers some
        insights into the two primary manners through which music can react to a
        player’s actions. As the player progresses through a level of the game
        they will actively make the player avatar, Mario, undertake a number of
        actions which the music directly responds to. In her analysis of Matthew
        Hindson’s <i>Nintendo Music</i> (2005)—which directly quotes musical
        material from the game—Jessica Crowe provides a motivic analysis of some
        of these signs within the context of a linearly sequenced musical work.
    </p>

    <p>
        She notes, for instance, the ‘mickey mousing’ of the Jump motif;
        <a class="button" id="fnref:15" href="#fn:15">15</a> borrowing from the
        language of film score analysis to describe an attemp by the composer to
        directly emulate the action on the screen musically, as was a common
        trope in early cartoons. She analyses the way this glissando of a fifth,
        which plays whenever Mario jumps, directly outlines the rapid rise of
        the character with the simultaneous ascent of the musical material.
    </p>

    <p>
        But what is missing when attempting to apply this analysis to the game
        itself as opposde to Hindson’s derivative concert work is an
        understanding of these musical signs as they emerge from the sound
        system as well as the gameplay objects which they are accompanying.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within a standard playthrough of the game’s first level the player will
        encounter three musical signs which react immediately and directly to
        the players actions. These are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The glissando jump, as outlined above,</li>
        <li>The sharp leap of a fourth which plays whenever the player avatar collects a coin, and</li>
        <li>A series of rapid arpeggios, which correspond to Mario powering up upon collecting a mushroom.</li>
    </ul>

    <img class="figure" src="./images/figure-4.png" alt="Three musical scores displaying the jump, coin, and power-up musical cues from Super Mario Bros.">
    <p class="figure">
        <b>Fig. 4:</b> Interactive musical signs from <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        As Richard Stevens expresses, because each of these musical cues
        corresponds directly to player input, we can define them as ‘interactive
        signs’ which signal a specific and singular ludic event.
        <a class="button" id="fnref:16" href="#fn:16">16</a> 
        And we can see from this that as a result of this ludomusical
        interaction the object of the mushroom sign becomes less evident. A
        motivic analysis would state that the arpeggiated motif signals the
        action of eating a mushroom, but this does not hold wholly true when
        considered in a gameplay context. Instead, our analysis must consider the
        game-state change in which Mario powers-up.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can see, therefore, that often the musical signs of game music are
        not attempting to signify narrative objects within a player’s
        alterbiography but instead to represent the object of changing gameplay
        elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stevens delineates these interactive signs from other musical material
        which responds to player actions in a less direct and immediate manner.
        He refers to this latter category as ‘adaptive music’.
        <a class="button" id="fnref:17" href="#fn:17">17</a> The most evident of
        these is the sign which plays when the player takes too long to complete
        a level; allowing the timer in the upper right-hand corner of the screen
        to reach 100. If the player allows the timer to drop all the way to 0
        then the game will change to a ‘game over’ fail state and they will be
        forced to restart their progress through the level.
    </p>

    <img class="figure" src="./images/figure-5.png" alt="A musical score displaying the hurry-up musical cue from Super Mario Bros.">
    <p class="figure">
        <b>Fig. 5:</b> An adaptive musical sign from <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        As this is an undesirable scenario the musical sign acts as a warning,
        and is signalling the object of an upcoming potential state which the
        player should attempt to avoid by finishing the level as quickly as
        possible. This shows the game musci can not only signify previous
        gameplay actions and current gameplay states but also upcoming and
        potential events and states.
    </p>

    <h4 id="ludomusical-poiesis">Ludomusical Poiesis</h4>

    <p>
        There has been little research so far that specifically applies the
        semiotic constructs outlined above to video game music. The most
        prominent researcher in this area is Iain Hart who suggests that in
        applying the discipline we should “conduct separate semiotic analyses of
        video game music’s initial composition and interactive configuration.”
        <a class="button" id="fnref:18" href="#fn:18">18</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        This accounts for the incompleteness of game music’s received meanings
        without the context of the player’s interaction whilst still accounting
        for the creator’s intended compositional meanings. Hart’s anlysis of
        game music’s interactive configurations is of note as he applies Espen
        Aarseth’s concept of ergodic texts for which “work has to be done to
        them in order to interpret them”
        <a class="button" id="fnref:19" href="#fn:19">19</a> to the esthesic
        portion of the semiosis process. This helps to model the way in which
        the player’s actions impact upon their own interpretation of the work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hart introduces—though does not expand upon in detail—the player’s own
        creation and configuration of musical signs within the game audio
        system. And this is the point at which we diverge on some key points.
        Hart’s conception of ludomusical semiosis is one of active
        interpretation and engagement on the part of the player who takes the
        role of a musical performer whose instrument is the game audio system.
        I feel that this implies a far too great degree of intentionality with
        regard to the way these systems operate in practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unlike a musical performer, a video game player rarely considers
        themselves as actively creating and configuring musical material. We
        should therefore be careful in utilising such active language when
        describing a player’s interactions with game audio systems. It is for
        this reason that I am in favour of the more neutral term ‘poiesis’ when
        describing these ludomusical interactions.
    </p>

    <p class="figure">
        <b>Fig. 6:</b> Semiosis of Interactive Configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
        I therefore term my model of this subconcious system of musical creation
        and configuration between the player, game system, and composer
        as ‘ludomusical poiesis’. And there are still a number of unanswered
        questions and areas of interest regarding its effect on the player’s
        interpretation and/or creation of the object which musical signs
        signify.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, if we apply Chris Tonelli’s analysis of game music to
        signify the player or their avatar
        <a class="button" id="fnref:20" href="#fn:20">20</a> is there the
        potential for the players alterbiography to create musical signs that
        signify the object of their identity?
    </p>

    <p>
        To what extent do musical signs compel players towards certain ludic
        actions that create further complementary musical signs?
    </p>

    <p>
        Is the use of nostalgic rhetoric in music, as express by Jessica
        Kizzire, <a class="button" id="fnref:21" href="#fn:21">21</a> in some
        part a function of the player’s own ludomusical experience?
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to ludomusicology’s youth as an analytical discipline there is a
        veritable wealth of places to take this field of research, and boundless
        cross-disciplinary methods to consider when trying to construct new ways

        works. And I, for one, am ecstastic at the opportunities to keep
        lighting the crucible.
