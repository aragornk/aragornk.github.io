    <h1>On Ludomusical Poiesis</h1>
    <h2>Performative Semiotics in Video Game Music</h2>

    <p>
        One of the key issues game music researchers face is the loose
        association betweent the musical material of a game and the
        visual/narrative components it accompanies. As a result of the medium's
        inherent interactivity game music's meaning can often not be understood
        merely through its direct connection to the information conveyed on the
        screen when it plays. Instead the musical material must be interpreted
        by both the player and analyst in relation to the game world and game
        states it arises from. One framework through which this distinction
        between the interpretive meanings of linearly sequenced audio-visual
        media and non-linear, interactive media is that provided by the field
        of semiotics. In this proposal I briefly outline the relevant
        key-concepts of semiotics and summarise how they have been historically
        applied to musical material. Then, through a case study of <i>Super
        Mario Bros.</i> for the Nintendo Entertainment System, I draw upon the
        limited field of ludomusicology to interpret the initial game state
        meanings of musical signs in the game before dicussing the player's
        role as a musical performer who creates and configures those signs to
        the same extent as the composer and sound designer. This introduces the
        action of ludomusical poiesis which is the core concept of my research.

    <p>
        The field of ludomusicology is still relatively new, with academic
        discussions in the discipline only beginning in earnest in the
        mid-2000s. <a class="footnoteref" id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1">1</a> And
        due to the medium's interent interactivity one of the key concepts
        being investigated in the discipline is the participation of the player
        as a musical performer. This difference between the active musical
        involvement of the audience in interactive media as opposed to their
        passive spectatorship in linearly sequenced media requires researchers
        to adopt a fundamentally different analytical approach when
        interpreting this new compositional format.
        <a class="footnoteref" id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2">2</a> So far this has
        been approached through several different pre-existing analytical
        methods. One approach has been to study how game music composers
        approach non-linear harmonic structures. This is seen through the
        procedural generation of consonant pitches in accordance with Johann
        Fux's counterpoint treatise as heard in <i>Spore.</i>
        <a class="footnoteref" id="fnref:3" href="#fn:3">3</a> Psychological
        studies have also been referred to in order to investigate how music
        impacts upon the player's gameplay performance to either enhance or
        impede their progression through a game. For reference, see Warren
        Brodsky's analysis of faster-tempo music in driving games to reinforce
        the player's impulses for faster, less accurate driving.
        <a class="footnoteref" id="fnref:4" href="#fn:4">4</a> Elizabeth 
        Medina-Gray has employed form analysis by comparing modular musical
        systems to the aleatoric compositional approaches of mid-twentieth
        century composers.
        <a class="footnoteref" id="fnref:5" href="#fn:5">5</a> The field of
        hermeneutics has also been referred to by Miciel Kamp to investigate
        how players “interpret video game music for a number of practical or
        functional purposes” which are informed by their phenomenological
        experience with the game.
        <a class="footnoteref" id="fnref:6" href="#fn:6">6</a> Each of
        these approaches provide interesting insight into the interactions
        between the player and the musical material of the game. However, they
        are all lacking in an ability to demonstrate what specifically that music
        is conveying to the player. I believe therefore, that the area of
        research which is best equipped to construct an analytical method into
        the creation and interpretation of game music's extra-musical meaning
        is semiotics.
