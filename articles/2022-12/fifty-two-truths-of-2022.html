    <h1>The Fifty-Two Truths of 2022</h1>

    <p>
        <i>These personal aphorisms were collected one per week 
        throughout  2022, and first published on my Instagram story at
        the end of that year.</i>

        “The less you eat, drink, and read books; the less you go to the
        theatre, the dance hall, the public house; the less you think,
        love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save. The
        greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor rust will
        devour: your capital. The less you are, the more you have; the
        less you express your own life, the greater is your alienated life;
        the greater is the store of your estranged being.”

    <ol>
        <li>Knowledge often impedes understanding.</li>
        <li>Wilful ignorance impedes it more.</li>
        <li>Understanding is often a matter of velocity. Too fast and
            Shakespeare makes no sense. Too slow and he makes even less.</li>
        <li>Many things aren't your fault but are sure as hell your
            problem</li>
        <li>The greatest comforts are to be found nestled in the depths
            of ambiguity.</li>
        <li>It is fruitless to organise something you should instead be
            discarding.</li>
        <li>An explanation of your behaviour—on its own—does not
            constitute an apology.</li>
        <li>Neither does a mere proposotion preceded by the word 
            sorry.</li>
        <li>The incredible hulk is the platonic ideal of a lover.</li>
        <li>When unsure, it's best to keep moving. And get out of the
            way.</li>
        <li>No matter how absurd; satire still needs to be funny.</li>
        <li>You deserve the nicest screwdrivers you can afford.</li>
        <li>Whilst time constraint is a fact of adult life busyness
            results from a management error. If you find that your busyness
            has become permanent then you must learn to manage earlier,
            differently, and much, much better.</li>
        <li>A management error on your part should not constitute an
            emergency for others.</li>
        <li>“I got too busy to keep up” is an excellent reason to drop
            a T.V. Series. And an awful excuse to ruin a friendship.</li>
        <li>It is so often far easier to not be terrible.</li>
        <li>You are using too much detergent. Use less in hotter
            water.</li>
        <li>Some people care more about the attention you can give them
            than they'll ever care about you. The fault lies in them.</li>
        <li>These same people are experts at pretending to listen when
            they're just waiting to speak.</li>
        <li>The person who cares most about a relationship has the least
            power over it.</li>
        <li>Most unsolicited advice you want to give is for yourself, and
            not the person you're speaking to.</li>
        <li>Media can disgust, discomfit, challenge, and confront. It
            cannot harm.</li>
        <li>You should put a rubbish bin anywhere you repeatedly want to
            leave rubbish.</li>
        <li>It's best not to tell someone their negative feelings are
            wrong. Rarely is a sad person helped by being called a liar
            as well.</li>
        <li>It is rationally permissible to hold some illogical
            beliefs.</li>
        <li>Anger only helps when there's something specific to be angry
            at.</li>
        <li>It is okay to stop reading a book you're not enjoying.</li>
        <li>You should always prioritise maintaining a prior commitment
            over accepting a new one.</li>
        <li>You don't speak through a translator. But you do listen
            through one.</li>
        <li>It is okay, albeit difficult, to grieve over the loss of
            someone who's still alive.</li>
        <li>Middling art is just as, and often more, enriching than bad and
            good art.</li>
        <li>Information isn't useless if it amuses you.</li>
        <li>Love is not performative. But it must be expressed.</li>
        <li>There are numerous things in life worse and more damaging than
            hypocrisy; most notably the belief that eventually changing to
            become a little less of a jerk must be excoriated for is rank
            ‘hypocrisy’.</li>
        <li>People give recommendations for a reason. It's best to pay
            attention.</li>
        <li>Anything you can think of yields a lifetime of things to
            learn about.</li>
        <li>The more meaningless an argument the more substantial the
            differences it unveils.</li>
        <li>Loving music is not necessarily comorbid with loving
            performances.</li>
        <li>Many great performers don't love music. Every great musician
            does.</li>
        <li>You need to replace your kitchen sponge.</li>
        <li>Character is doing the right thing when no one is
            watching.</li>
        <li>Integrity is putting in effort when it's not going to
            matter.</li>
        <li>All articles titled “The True Meaning of…” are about
            something that doesn't even have a true meaning.</li>
        <li>All universal truths arrive with a qualification.</li>
        <li>Proust finished publishing <i>Á la Recherche du Temps
            Perdu</i> five years after he died. You needn't finish it
            any quicker.</li>
        <li>An aphorism is only useful in so far as it elicits discussion
            about why it's wrong.</li>
        <li>Team Edward vs. Team Jacob is just a waifu war.</li>
        <li>Billiards is about far more than angles.</li>
        <li>No matter how sound and complete, any ethical framework that
            justifies being an asshole isn't a very good one.</li>
        <li>You don't need to logically justify your feelings.</li>
        <li>Feelings are real.</li>
        <li>You don't get to choose what makes you emotional, but you do
            have a striking amount of agency over what makes you 
            irrational. Try to exercise it.</li>
